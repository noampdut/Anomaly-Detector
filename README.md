
# Anomaly Detection In C/C++ 

## Overview

This project is designed for advanced statistical analysis and anomaly detection in flight data. It includes a comprehensive module for performing key statistical computations and a robust server component for handling, processing, and analyzing time-series data from flights. The system is optimized to detect irregularities and ensure data integrity, providing crucial insights for aviation safety and performance monitoring.

## Features

- **Statistical Analysis**: Variance, covariance, and Pearson correlation coefficient calculations.
- **Linear Regression**: Includes functionality for regression line fitting and deviation calculations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect anomalies based on trained data and correlation models.
- **Server Component**: Handles data uploads, processing, and provides endpoints for retrieving results.
